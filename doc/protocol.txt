Control protocol for RS232 of Technix SR 5kw to 10kW devices
============================================================




RS232 line specs: 1 start bit, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity,
                  Full Duplex mode, baud rate 9600


The control protocol of Technix-HV SR series is very simple.  The
communication is based on command/answer message pairs, each ending
with CR (ASCII code 13).

Each 'command' consists of an ASCII character, followed by one or more
function parameters, and ends with CR. The 'answer' consists of the
string which was sent in the previous 'command' plus the ASCII
character string containing the actual answer, and ends with CR.


1) Output Voltage Programming

  Instruction: d1,X (X: 0 .. 4095)
  Answer: d1,X

2) Output Current Programming

  Instruction: d2,X (X: 0 .. 4095)
  Answer: d2,X

3) Output Voltage Monitor

  Instruction: a1
  Answer: a1X (X: 0 .. 4095)

4) Output Current Monitor

  Instruction: a2
  Answer: a2X (X: 0 .. 4095)

The 'X' above is a 12-bit unsigned integer, linearly scaled to cover
the whole voltage or current range of the PSU.  In our case
(SR100kV-5kW with negative polarity), e.g. for voltage X=0 corresponds
U=0V (ie. the ground potential), and X=4095 corresponds to U=-100kV.

5) HV On

  Instruction: P5,1
  Answer P5,1
  --> delay 100ms
  Instruction: P5,0
  Answer P5,0

6) HV Off

  Instruction: P6,1
  Answer P6,1
  --> delay 100ms
  Instruction: P6,0
  Answer P6,0

7) Local/remote mode

  Instruction: P7,1 Answer: P7,1: local mode
  Instruction: P7,0 Answer: P7,0: remote mode

8) Inhibit

 Instruction: P8,1 Answer: P8,1: inhibit
 Instruction: P8,0 Answer: P8,0: idle

9) Power supply status inquiry

  Instruction: E
  Answer: EX (X: 0 .. 255)

  Answer is 8 bit coded:

  - PL5, PL6, PL7, PL8 are input bits corresponding to P5, P6, P7 et
    P8 instructions (see the P? codes in the above sections 5-8).

  - PL1, PL2, PL3, PL4 bits are status bits for following information:

  PL1 = 1: voltage regulation
  PL1 = 0: current regulation

  PL2 = 1: fault
  PL2 = 0: no fault

  PL3 = 1: open interlock
  PL3 = 0: closed interlock

  PL4 = 1: HV ON
  PL4 = 0: HV OFF

  MSB                         LSB
  PL8 PL7 PL6 PL5 PL4 PL3 PL2 PL1




NOTE1: To be on the safe side, it might be wise to ensure, that no
       other commands are ever passed to HV generator.  We don't know
       how it handles undefined strings.

NOTE2: The input and output analog info (voltage and current) have 12
       bits resolution.

Installation
============

HVControl was written and tested in Python 3.7.3, so that or another relatively new Python version should be installed.

In addition to the Python standard library, HVControl uses the pySerial package (tested with version 3.4), which should also be installed.

After these dependencies are met, HVControl doesn't require any special installation steps; simply downloading the HVControl directory with its contents is sufficient.

In order to access the modules included in the program, the directory ``HVControl/hvcontrol/`` should be added to ``$PATH`` or made the working directory.

TODO:

### Current ###

### Important ###
- Capital letters to status str?
- run pylint/pycodestyle
- inhibit to inhibition
- config file as command-line kwarg

### Documentation ###
- Add better descriptions of inhibition and the interlock based on the manual 
- Document the results of the tests with the real hv generator
- Revise the examples
- Try to remove underlines from links?

### Not important (the program works well without) ###
- More functionality to VirtualHV
      - No voltage in off mode, when inhibition is on or when interlock is open
      - Shut off and switch to local mode after 5 seconds
      - Implement the behaviour of the physical device
- Try if this works on Windows?

### Other ###
- Testing (maybe try mock objects, Hypothesis)!
- Remove Message.from_bytes() and overload Message.__init__ with 
  @singledispatchmethod. Wait for Anaconda to update to Python 3.8 
  before this can be implemented.

TODO:

### Current ###

### Important ###
- Testing (maybe try mock objects)!
- Ask Pekko about the license

### Documentation ###
- Document imports in __init__
- Rewrite virtualconnection docs
- HV PSU to HV PS, HV generator etc?
- Does this work on windows?
- Implement :ref:`name <actual_ref>`-syntax
- Proofreading!
- Document the interlock (a physical safety switch which prevents turning the HV on)?
- Links to external docs

### Not important (the program works well without) ###
- File rights could be rw,r,r
- More functionality to VirtualHV
      - No voltage in off mode
      - Switch between voltage and current regulation
      - Shut off and switch to local mode after 5 seconds

### Test with the physical device ###
- Try to figure out what inhibit/inhibition is

### Ask Tomas ###
- Does polarity matter?

### Other ###
- Remove Message.from_bytes() and overload Message.__init__ with 
  @singledispatchmethod. Wait for Anaconda to update to Python 3.8 
  before this can be implemented.

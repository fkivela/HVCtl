TODO:

### Current ###
- Proofreading!

### Important ###
- Paths in sphinx config file

### Documentation ###
- Document the interlock (a physical safety switch which prevents turning the HV on)?

### Not important (the program works well without) ###
- More functionality to VirtualHV
      - No voltage in off mode
      - Shut off and switch to local mode after 5 seconds
      - Find out how the physical device works

### Test with the physical device ###
- Try to figure out what inhibit/inhibition is
- How does the HV behave when it is off? Does it respond to commands?
  What happens when trying to set voltage or current?
- How does the HV behave in local mode? Does it respond to commands?

### Ask Tomas ###
- Does polarity matter?

### Other ###
- Testing (maybe try mock objects, Hypothesis)!
- Remove Message.from_bytes() and overload Message.__init__ with 
  @singledispatchmethod. Wait for Anaconda to update to Python 3.8 
  before this can be implemented.

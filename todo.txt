TODO:

### Current ###
- Move status string formatting to AdvancedUI
- __main__: clui is a bad name DONE

### Important ###
- Capital letters to status str?
- VHV doesn't set inhibit
- run pylint/pycodestyle
- inhibit to inhibition

### Documentation ###
- Add better descriptions of inhibition and the interlock based on the manual 

### Not important (the program works well without) ###
- More functionality to VirtualHV
      - No voltage in off mode, when inhibition is on or when interlock is open
      - Shut off and switch to local mode after 5 seconds
      - Find out how the physical device works
- Try if this works on Windows?

### Test with the physical device ###
- Test inhibition & interlock
- How does the HV behave when it is off? Does it respond to commands?
  What happens when trying to set voltage or current?
- How does the HV behave in local mode? Does it respond to commands?
- Are the examples realistic

### Other ###
- Testing (maybe try mock objects, Hypothesis)!
- Remove Message.from_bytes() and overload Message.__init__ with 
  @singledispatchmethod. Wait for Anaconda to update to Python 3.8 
  before this can be implemented.

TODO:

### Now ###

### Soon ###
- Run Pylint and Pycodestyle

### Test with HV generator ###
- Test the timeout option in the configuration file.
  Does specifying a timeout get rid of all blocking commands?
- Make sure API.halt() works correctly if HVCtl is stopped while it is 
  connected to the HV
- Test whether opening the interlock in the HV off state causes a fault
  condition

### Maybe later ###
- Test the program. unittest.mock and/or the Hypothesis library should be
  looked into
- Message.from_bytes() could be replaced by overloading Message.__init__ with 
  @singledispatchmethod. However, this would need Python 3.8 so it might not
  be practical even in the future (HVCtl might need to run on machines which
  don't have Python 3.8)

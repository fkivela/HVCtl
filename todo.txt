TODO:

### Current ###
- Split commands at any whitespace instead of just ' '

### Important ###
- API(port) not working causes confusion (use * to force keyword arguments?)
- Testing (maybe try mock objects)!
- Convert voltage to positive
- Ask Pekko about the license

### Documentation ###
- Document imports in __init__
- Rewrite virtualconnection docs
- HV PSU to HV PS, HV generator etc?
- Does this work on windows?
- Implement :ref:`name <actual_ref>`-syntax
- Proofreading!
- Document the interlock (a physical safety switch which prevents turning the HV on)?
- Links to external docs

### Not important (the program works well without) ###
- virtualconnection/hv inheritance -> composition
- _poll -> run_poll
- shorten the name of virtualconnection (and maybe command_line_ui)?
- File rights could be rw,r,r
- More functionality to VirtualHV
- Try pyLint?
- to_bytes -> __bytes__? (Maybe change __init__ into a generic function?)

### Test with the physical device ###
- Try to fugure out what inhibit/inhibition is

    """A virtual serial connection.
    
    Data can be sent through a VirtualConnection object by accessing 
    the *user_end* and *virtual_end* attributes. *virtual_end* can be 
    written to and read from with os.read and os.write. 
    os.read doesn't seem to work with *user_end*, and the serial 
    module should be used instead. The *port* attribute returns a 
    device name which can be given to serial.Serial() as an argument.
    
    A VirtualConnection object runs code in a parallel thread.
    If a VC is not closed after the it is no longer needed, 
    it may continue using resources needlessly.
    A VC may be closed with
    >> vc.close()
    This stops the parallel thread, closes vc.user_end and 
    vc.virtual_end, and frees their file descriptors.
    
    If a VC is used with a "with" block in the following manner:
    >> with VirtualConnection as vc:
    >>     # code here
    the VC will close automatically when the "with" block is exited.
    
    It is possible for a VC to continue running even if there 
    are no accessible references to it. 
    This happens e.g. if a VC is 
    defined in an IPython console and then deleted using "del vc".
    This deletes the name "vc", but doesn't seem to garbage-collect 
    the object.
    In this case, all running instances of the VirtualConnection class 
    can be closed with
    >> VirtualConnection.close_all()
